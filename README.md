# MasteringHPCC

HPCC Systems is an Open Source Big Data supercomputing platform that is an alternative to the Hadoop and Spark worlds. The Mastering HPCC Systems series introduces the HPCC Systems platform to anyone interested in evaluating it for use on their own big data projects. It also expands the ECL programming knowledge of anyone already working with the platform.

This directory contains the ECL code files for all the Mastering HPCC Systems series of books (available on Amazon.com and Google Books).
